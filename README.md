# Formula 1 Race Outcome Prediction

## Executive Overview

### 1. The Problem Area
In the dynamic and data-rich world of Formula 1 racing, predicting race outcomes poses significant challenges due to incomplete historical data, race condition variability, and fluctuations in team and driver performances. This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to analyze datasets encompassing race history, driver and constructor standings, weather conditions, and qualifying times. Our goal is to enhance prediction accuracy, thereby improving team strategies, betting odds, and fan engagement through data-driven insights.

### 2. The User
The beneficiaries of this project include:

- Formula 1 Teams and Strategists: Refining race strategies and optimizing performance.
- Sports Analysts and Betting Companies: Gaining enhanced accuracy in race outcome predictions.
- The F1 Fan Base: Engaging more deeply with the sport through insights into race predictions and the influencing factors.
This initiative aims to foster a more informed and engaged Formula 1 community, integrating data-driven decisions and enhancing fan interactions within the sport's ecosystem. AWS Sports Analytics for F1.

### 3. The Big Idea
Employing machine learning techniques, this project aims to surpass traditional prediction methods by identifying patterns and insights within extensive datasets. Utilizing regression analysis, classification, and neural networks, we strive to enhance the precision of predictions, thereby transforming competitive sports outcome forecasting.

### 4. The Impact
The aspiration of this project is to test out various data science modelling methods to see if we can predict the likely race winner of each race.

### 5. The Data
Utilizing data from official F1 sources, OpenF1 API, and Ergast F1 APIs, this project aims to create a comprehensive predictive model. The datasets include lap times, grid positions, weather conditions, driver and team characteristics, dynamic race elements, and more, offering a holistic view of Formula 1 racing dynamics.
